# ðŸ“ˆ Bitcoin Local Extrema Trading Bot

This project implements a **Bitcoin trading strategy** based on detecting **local maxima and minima** in price movements.  
The algorithm buys at **local minima** and sells at **local maxima**, using volatility filters (ATR) to avoid noise.  

The project is structured into four Python modules:
1. **fetching_data.py** â†’ Fetch historical BTC data using `ccxt`  
2. **price_smoother.py** â†’ Apply smoothing (EMA, Savitzkyâ€“Golay) & calculate derivatives  
3. **local_min_max.py** â†’ Detect extrema, generate buy/sell signals with ATR filter  
4. **bot.py** â†’ Paper trade live BTC/USDT with simulated PnL logging  
5. **indicator.py** â†’ Creating savgol filters
6. **backtesting.py** â†’ Testing the code wit vectorbt
7. **trades.csv** â†’ For logging buy and sell signals created

Note: I have recently started learning finance so with knowledge I have so far I created this project. I am going to enhance this project while I proceed learning.
Note: I accumulated all of the code into bot.py;thus, you only need to use bot.py. The others I created while I learning.
